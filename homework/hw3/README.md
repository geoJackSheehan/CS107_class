# Submission instructions

Homework must be submitted in your private Git repository hosted in the CS107
organization at <https://code.harvard.edu/CS107>. Only commits before or at the
due date are considered for grading. The homework due date is indicated on the
problem sheet and displayed in the
[schedule](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2022-CS107/pages/schedule_static.html).

Please see the [homework
tutorial](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2022-CS107/pages/tutorials.html#tutorial-hw)
for the correct submission procedure.  The summarized steps are:

1. Checkout a new branch called `hw3`.  This branch should be based off your
   `main` or `master` branch.
2. Solve the homework on the `hw3`.  Commit often and logically.
3. Your final work must be submitted in the directory
   `homework/hw3/submission` in your private Git repository.
4. Create an open pull request to merge your `hw3` branch into your `main` or
   `master` branch (you could also do this after step 1).  The last commit on or
   just before the deadline in the *open* pull request will graded.  *Do not
   merge the open pull request before we have graded your work.*
5. Zip your `submission` directory and submit it on Gradescope:
